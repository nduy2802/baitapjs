Thanks for downloading cs2_aim! 



The directory that you need to place the 'cs2_aim.vpk' file is found here:

YOURDRIVE:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\maps

After you've placed the map file in the correct map folder, open up the game and in console type:

	map cs2_aim

This should load you into the map with all the parameters set by the configuration packed with the map.



However, due to CS2 not fully supporting custom game modes yet, you may sometimes face an issue when trying to play this map.

Some things I've noticed are quite common are:

- you load into the map and you can't run any cheat restricted CVARS
- you spawn with only 9 bots or the bots are moving

Both of these issues seem to be fully fixed by restarting CS2 and waiting a moment 
before loading the map again when you reach the main menu. The latter you can often fix by just reloading the map
again (in console: map cs2_aim).



Feel free to message me on reddit or on 
steam (1277442) if you're having any problems with the map, or if you have any suggestions.
